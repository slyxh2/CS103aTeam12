        Hi, this is Ting. I am from Ningbo, China and I love swimming and singing.
        As a product manager for Fund Management at my last company, I was instrumental in establishing the firmâ€™s financial accounting system.

        For this GPT app, I built a query page about travel plan. When people travel, they always worry about local attractions and food. 
        If you can make a strategy before traveling, you can save a lot of time and improve the quality of travel.
